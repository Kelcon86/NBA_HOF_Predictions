# NBA Hall of Fame Predictions

## Selected topic
NBA Hall of Fame predictions based on players rookie year statistics

## Reason why topic was selected
After brainstorming we found that everyone in the group had an interest in sports. We knew there would be an abundance of data for professional sports leagues and decided to choose a topic involving the National Basketball Association (NBA). 

## Data Source Description
We found several datasets that contained data for this topic, but ultimately chose to use NBA Rookies by Year_Hall of Fame Class.xlsx found on data.world. This file was then converted into a csv (nba_hof_rookies.csv).

## Questions we hope to answer with the data
- Can we accurately predict an NBA players induction into the Hall of Fame based on their statistics from their rookie season

## Description of the communication protocols
Our group has communicated through a dedicated Slack channel as well as via Zoom.
